# Breakdown of tasks and roles

## **Joshua Hebert**

Project lead, ran daily scrum and delegated tasks to other team members. Worked on JavaScript search
bar functionality HTML links for bottom of page. Wrote a proposal and led a presentation for the team.

## **Isaiah Jordan**

Built JavaScript functions to pull movie information from IMDB API and helped keep the project board
organized for everyone's daily tasks and activities. Very helpful in getting information from API and
sharing easy ways to implement JS functions for team

## **Joseph Rudasill**

Provided the entire layout through dynamic HTML and introduced us all to Tailwinds CSS. Joseph
created a fun layout for everyone to be able to add javascript too and was a workhorse through entire
project (Note from Joseph : Could not have done it without ya'll)

## **Alex Helm**

Helped with API keys and pulling information needed, when we had to switch gears at the last minute
because of API issues Alex helped get HTML and CSS fixed for the new layout.

# Challenges

We were faced with many challenges using the Marvel API which led us to scrap our original idea and
move towards an easier layout with access to different APIS. The team worked together well and we
were able to put out a product that we were all happy with!

# Successes

- We all were able to learn about Tailwind CSS which is used very often in our field.
- We were presented with real life challenges that may happen daily in the field and I feel like we
  troubleshooted and executed a backup plan under pressure very well.

# Demo (will be on soon)

# Directions for Future Development

Adding more searchable information about comics as the API provides a
pretty vast wealth of information that can help create a more dynamic
searchable site in the future.
